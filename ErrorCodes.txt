1: Undefined/unknown/should never happen error, contact manufacturer.
2: Wrong command order.
3: Data/Command/String/Index too long/out of bounds.
4: Wrong TX format version.
5: Invalid amount (BOBC supports polling the card for its max charge before charging it, larger purchases have to be split up).
6: Invalid address.
7: Not enough funds or card needs to be updated with TX sources.
8: Card has not been unlocked (it is "free" to check by calling delayunlock, it if card is already unlocked!) (No PIN amounts do not require time unlocking)
9: Card has no space for new sources, use or dump existing sources./Not enough storage.
10: Does not contain expected data. Unspent TX out may not be owned by the card or script is not standard.
11: Source is already known or spent.
12: Device does not accept data, may have own connection and/or enough data. (Mostly useful for non-card BOBC implementing devices.)
13: Not enough difficulty, block header sent should have a difficulty of at least 1/10.000 of cards average figure. (UNUSED ERROR)
14: Decimals value not supported (BOBC-0/protocol=0 cards usually expect 8).
15: Card must be reset with a zero charge + pin to charge higher amounts or card is already waiting for a reset pin, before it can be charged again.
16: ECpDSA library error, contact manufacturer.
17: Charged amount is below the dust limit.
