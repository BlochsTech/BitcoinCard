1. Path of BCLOAD.EXE
C:\Program Files (x86)\BasicCardV8

2. Right-click card project and under output files make sure .img is selected.

3. Compile card program and get the .IMG file from project folder.

4. Put BCLoad copy and Img file into the same folder.

5. Plug in the RFID reader and find its com port.

6. Per experience the RFID reader will map itself to COM port 102 and 103. I theorize that one of them is the contact reader in the Omnikey device
and the other is the RFID reader in the Omnikey device. (103 seems to be the RFID port)

7. Use CMD to run the load command with params:
-> CD  >PATH<
-> BCLoad BitcoinCard.img -E -STest -P103

8. The error file will appear in the folder you put the two files and no paths will be needed.
